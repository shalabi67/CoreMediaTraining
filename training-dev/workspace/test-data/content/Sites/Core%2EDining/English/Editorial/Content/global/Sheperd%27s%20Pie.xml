However, this tasty meal can be an enrichment for any cook world wide.</p><p/><p class="p--heading-2">Content<br/></p><p>for 4 persons<br/></p><p class="p--heading-3"/><p>3/4 - 11/2lb.

Cook until tender, and drain immediately. While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the mince.</p><p>If the mince is raw, use the following method. Melt 1 oz. (25 g.) of butter in a frying pan and fry the onion lightly in it. Add the mince and stir until lightly browned. Add the stock and simmer gently for 30 minutes. Allow to stand for a few minutes then skim off as much fat as possible. Season highly with the salt and pepper.</p><p>Thicken the liquid a little by stirring in the cornflour, mixed to a paste with a little water. Boil for 3 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent sticking. Turn into an ovenproof dish in which the pie will be served. The meat must cool enough to form a skin before the potato is put on to it.</p><p>If you use meat already cooked, fry the onion as above and stir it into the mince. Season well and add a little thickened stock until the meat has a soft, moist consistency. Set aside to form a skin.</p><p>Mash the cooked potatoes with at least 1 oz. (25 g.) of butter and enough milk to make it creamy. Season well. When the mince has a skin, spread the mashed potato on top carefully, so that it does not sink into the mince. The potato layer should be about 1 - 11/2 in. (2.5 - 4 cm.) thick. Mark the top with a fork, and dot with the remaining butter. Bake for 30 minutes near the top of the oven so that the potato is well browned.</p></div></text>
